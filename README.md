# TweetMap
## General Description

* The TweetMap web application collects tweets from a live stream and processes them to display certain tweets, that contain keywords, on GoogleMaps. 

* Created a web application to process and display real-time tweets on Google Maps using Python Flask.
* Fetched tweets using Twitter Streaming APIs, and indexed tweets for searching on AWS ElasticSearch.
* Deployed the application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk in an auto-scaling environment at http://tweetmapp.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/. 
* Used ElasticSearchâ€™s geospatial feature to shows tweets that are within a 500km radius from the point the user clicks on the map.
